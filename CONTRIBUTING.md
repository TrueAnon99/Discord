Here are the guidelines for your work to be accepted into the project.

## Licensing

By submitting your work into the docs repository, you have put it in the
**Public Domain** to the best of my ability. Anyone can use the documentation
for any reason, commercial or not, crediting or not.

## Reverse Engineering Policy

At a high level, this documentation is made to the best of our ability through
black-box testing. Only when that does not suffice that you should attempt
different approaches.
